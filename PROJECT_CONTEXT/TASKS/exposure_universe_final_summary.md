## Key Design Decisions

1. **Cash/Risk-Free Rate Added**: Essential for:
   - Modeling leverage costs in Return Stacked products
   - Fund replication accuracy (leverage cost = RF rate + spread)
   - Attribution analysis (returns from leverage vs. selection)

2. **TIPS as Real Asset**: Moved from Fixed Income to Real Assets because:
   - Primary purpose is inflation protection
   - Behaves like other real assets in inflationary periods
   - Natural grouping with commodities and real estate

2. **"Nominal" Fixed Income**: Renamed from just "Fixed Income" to:
   - Distinguish from inflation-linked bonds
   - Clarify these are fixed-rate instruments
   - Emphasize the real vs. nominal return distinction

3. **Factor/Style Split**: 
   - Equities: Pure equity factor strategies
   - Other: Multi-asset strategies (includes futures carry)

4. **Hierarchical Benefits**:
   - Clean organization for code implementation
   - Clear categorization for reporting
   - Logical groupings for correlation analysis
   - Easy to extend with new exposures

## Ready for Implementation

This hierarchical structure provides:
- ✅ Clear taxonomy for all exposures
- ✅ Logical groupings for analysis
- ✅ Clean separation of real vs. nominal assets
- ✅ Proper classification of inflation hedges
- ✅ Foundation for hierarchical risk models
