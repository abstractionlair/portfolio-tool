# Task Clarification: Building on Parameter Optimization

**Created**: 2025-01-07 by Desktop Claude
**Purpose**: Clarify the relationship between completed work and current task

## What's Already Built
The parameter optimization framework (Task 25) answers: **"What parameters should we use?"**
- Tests different EWMA lambdas (0.90-0.98)
- Tests different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Validates on historical data: "If we used these parameters, how accurate would our forecasts have been?"
- Provides optimal parameters for different forecast horizons

## What We Need Now
The Exposure Risk Estimator answers: **"What are the forward-looking risk estimates?"**
- Takes the validated optimal parameters
- Applies them to current market data
- Generates volatility estimates for each exposure
- Builds correlation matrix between exposures
- Provides inputs for portfolio optimization

## Example Flow
```python
# Step 1: Parameter Optimization (ALREADY COMPLETE)
optimizer = ParameterOptimizer(exposure_universe)
results = optimizer.optimize_all_parameters(start_date, end_date)
# Results tell us: "For 21-day forecasts, use lambda=0.94 with weekly data"

# Step 2: Risk Estimation (WHAT WE'RE BUILDING)
risk_estimator = ExposureRiskEstimator(exposure_universe, optimizer)
vols, corr = risk_estimator.get_risk_matrix(
    exposures=['us_equity_large_cap', 'us_treasury_long'],
    estimation_date=datetime.now(),
    forecast_horizon=21
)
# Results: "US Large Cap volatility forecast: 16.5% annualized"

# Step 3: Portfolio Optimization (EXISTING, NEEDS RISK INPUTS)
optimizer = OptimizationEngine()
result = optimizer.optimize(
    expected_returns=...,  # Low priority
    covariance_matrix=corr * np.outer(vols, vols),  # THIS IS WHAT WE NEED
    constraints=...
)
```

## Key Insight
Parameter optimization is like finding the best recipe through testing.
Risk estimation is using that recipe to actually cook the meal.

We have the recipe (optimal parameters), now we need to cook (generate estimates).
