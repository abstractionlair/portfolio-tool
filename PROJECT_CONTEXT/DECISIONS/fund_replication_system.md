# Fund Replication and Exposure Discovery System - Design Notes

**Created**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Future Enhancement (Medium Priority)  
**Context**: Currently using imported exposure mappings from external spreadsheet analysis

## Overview

While we've successfully imported fund exposure mappings from spreadsheet-based analysis, building an in-system replication capability would provide several advantages:

1. **Continuous Validation**: Verify that funds continue to deliver their expected exposures
2. **New Fund Discovery**: Analyze new funds without external tools
3. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Detect and adapt to changes in fund strategies
4. **Transparency**: Full audit trail of how exposures were determined

## Key Design Decisions to Make

### 1. Exposure Categories
Need to decide on the optimal set of exposure categories:

**Asset Class Based:**
- US Equity (Large, Mid, Small)
- International Developed Equity
- Emerging Markets Equity
- Government Bonds (Short, Intermediate, Long)
- Corporate Bonds (IG, HY)
- Real Estate
- Commodities
- Cash/Money Market

**Factor Based:**
- Market Beta
- Value
- Momentum
- Quality
- Low Volatility
- Size

**Strategy Based:**
- Trend Following
- Carry
- Long/Short Equity
- Merger Arbitrage
- Convertible Arbitrage

### 2. Replication Assets
Need representative, liquid ETFs/funds for each exposure:

```yaml
replication_universe:
  US_LARGE_EQUITY:
    primary: SPY
    alternatives: [VOO, IVV]
  US_SMALL_VALUE:
    primary: VBR
    alternatives: [IWN, SLYV]
  MANAGED_FUTURES:
    primary: DBMF
    alternatives: [KMLM, CTA]
```

### 3. Technical Architecture

```python
class ReplicationEngine:
    """Engine for discovering fund exposures through return replication."""
    
    def __init__(self, return_provider: ReturnDataProvider):
        self.return_provider = return_provider
        self.replication_assets = load_replication_universe()
    
    def discover_exposures(
        self, 
        fund_ticker: str,
        start_date: date,
        end_date: date,
        constraints: Optional[Dict] = None
    ) -> ReplicationResult:
        """Run regression to discover fund exposures."""
        # Get returns
        fund_returns = self.return_provider.get_returns(fund_ticker, start_date, end_date)
        factor_returns = self._get_factor_returns(start_date, end_date)
        
        # Run constrained regression
        exposures = self._run_regression(fund_returns, factor_returns, constraints)
        
        # Calculate quality metrics
        metrics = self._calculate_metrics(fund_returns, factor_returns, exposures)
        
        return ReplicationResult(exposures, metrics)
```

### 4. Data Requirements

**Return Data:**
- Daily returns for funds and replication assets
- Adjusted for dividends and splits
- Handle missing data appropriately

**Storage:**
- Time series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB?)
- Or simple Parquet files with good indexing
- Cache API calls to avoid rate limits

### 5. Replication Methods

**Basic OLS:**
- Simple, interpretable
- May need constraints (non-negative, sum to leverage)

**Rolling Window:**
- Detect time-varying exposures
- Identify regime changes

**Bayesian Methods:**
- Incorporate priors based on fund descriptions
- Better handling of short histories

**LASSO/Ridge:**
- Handle multicollinearity
- Automatic selection of relevant factors

### 6. Quality Metrics

```python
@dataclass
class ReplicationMetrics:
    r_squared: float
    tracking_error: float
    information_ratio: float
    max_rolling_tracking_error: float
    stability_score: float  # How stable are exposures over time
    t_statistics: Dict[str, float]  # Statistical significance
```

### 7. Monitoring and Alerts

- Track replication quality over time
- Alert when R² drops below threshold
- Detect significant exposure shifts
- Flag when fund behavior changes

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Basic Replication**
- Simple OLS with constraints
- Manual execution for specific funds
- Basic quality metrics

**Phase 2: Automated Discovery**
- Scheduled replication runs
- Store results with versioning
- Compare to existing mappings

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Time-varying exposures
- Regime detection
- Factor timing models

**Phase 4: Integration**
- Auto-update fund definitions
- API for real-time queries
- Web UI for exploration

## Example Use Cases

1. **New Fund Analysis**: "What are the exposures of this new Return Stacked ETF?"
2. **Drift Detection**: "Has PSTKX maintained its 50/50 bonds/equity split?"
3. **Factor Evolution**: "How have factor exposures changed over time?"
4. **Custom Replication**: "Can we replicate this expensive fund with cheaper ETFs?"

## Open Questions

1. How frequently should we re-run replications?
2. What threshold of R² is "good enough"?
3. How do we handle funds with dynamic strategies?
4. Should we support custom factor definitions?
5. How do we version exposure definitions over time?

## Notes

- Current spreadsheet-based approach works well for now
- This system would complement, not replace, fundamental analysis
- Important to maintain skepticism about purely statistical exposures
- Consider regulatory/disclosure data as additional input
