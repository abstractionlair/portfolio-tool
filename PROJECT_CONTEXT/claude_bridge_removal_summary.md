# Claude Bridge Removal Summary

Date: 2025-01-04

## Changes Made

### Files Updated:
1. **PROJECT_CONTEXT/CURRENT_STATE.md**
   - Removed references to Claude Bridge being implemented
   - Updated to reflect PROJECT_CONTEXT as the coordination mechanism
   - Removed claude_bridge/ and .claude-bridge/ from directory structure

2. **PROJECT_CONTEXT/PROJECT_GUIDE.md**
   - Changed communication method from ".claude-bridge/" to direct task file updates
   - Updated workflow examples to use task files instead of bridge messages

3. **PROJECT_CONTEXT/ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Changed "AI Coordination (Claude Bridge)" to "AI Coordination (PROJECT_CONTEXT)"
   - Updated benefits to reflect simpler file-based approach

4. **PROJECT_CONTEXT/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**
   - Updated handoff pattern to use task files instead of bridge messages

5. **PROJECT_CONTEXT/DECISIONS/003-ai-coordination.md**
   - Removed Claude Bridge as second component
   - Updated to show PROJECT_CONTEXT as the sole coordination mechanism
   - Revised workflow patterns to use task files
   - Updated future enhancements to remove bridge-specific items

### Files Removed:
1. **test_claude_bridge.py** → renamed to test_claude_bridge.py.removed
2. **docs/claude-bridge-spec.md** → renamed to docs/claude-bridge-spec.md.removed

## Result
The project now uses a simpler, cleaner coordination approach where:
- All AI assistants share PROJECT_CONTEXT as the single source of truth
- Communication happens through direct updates to task files
- No separate messaging system is needed
- The human facilitates switching between assistants

This approach is more aligned with how AI assistants actually work and removes unnecessary complexity.
