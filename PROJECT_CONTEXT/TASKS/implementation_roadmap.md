# Task Implementation Roadmap

**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Purpose**: Clear sequence of implementation tasks for Claude Code

## Overview
We have 5 concrete tasks to implement the data infrastructure and visualization. Each task builds on the previous ones, creating a complete system.

## Task Sequence

### ðŸš€ Task 1: Rate Series Support (CURRENT)
**File**: `/PROJECT_CONTEXT/TASKS/1_implement_rate_series_fetcher.md`  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Blockers**: None  
**Critical Path**: YES - Everything depends on this

What to implement:
- Add `fetch_rate_series_returns()` to TotalReturnFetcher
- Handle FRED data (rates not prices)
- Convert annual rates to period returns
- Integrate with existing exposure fetching

### ðŸ“‹ Task 2: Exposure Universe Integration
**File**: `/PROJECT_CONTEXT/TASKS/2_implement_exposure_universe.md`  
**Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Blockers**: Task 1 must be complete  
**Critical Path**: YES

What to implement:
- Create ExposureUniverse class
- Load YAML configuration
- Handle different implementation types
- Integrate with TotalReturnFetcher

### ðŸ“‹ Task 3: Data Availability Testing
**File**: `/PROJECT_CONTEXT/TASKS/3_create_data_availability_test.md`  
**Time**: 2 hours  
**Blockers**: Tasks 1 & 2  
**Critical Path**: NO - But highly valuable

What to implement:
- Comprehensive test script
- Check all tickers and data sources
- Generate availability report
- Identify what needs fixing

### ðŸ“‹ Task 4: Optimization Integration
**File**: `/PROJECT_CONTEXT/TASKS/4_integrate_decomposition_optimization.md`  
**Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Blockers**: Tasks 1 & 2  
**Critical Path**: NO - Enhancement

What to implement:
- Add decomposition support to optimizer
- Enable real return optimization
- Create examples showing value
- Maintain backwards compatibility

### ðŸ“‹ Task 5: Visualization Tools
**File**: `/PROJECT_CONTEXT/TASKS/5_create_visualization_tools.md`  
**Time**: 4-5 hours  
**Blockers**: Core infrastructure (Tasks 1 & 2)  
**Critical Path**: NO - But high user value

What to implement:
- Performance charts
- Allocation visualizations
- Optimization results display
- Interactive dashboards

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Data (Tasks 1 & 2)
**Goal**: Get all data flowing properly
- Must complete before anything else
- Unlocks all other features
- Test thoroughly

### Phase 2: Validation (Task 3)
**Goal**: Know what works and what doesn't
- Run immediately after Phase 1
- Identifies remaining data issues
- Guides future improvements

### Phase 3: Enhancements (Tasks 4 & 5)
**Goal**: Make the system powerful and usable
- Can work on these in parallel
- Task 4 adds sophisticated features
- Task 5 makes everything visual

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All exposures can fetch data (Task 1 & 2)
- [ ] We know exactly what data is available (Task 3)
- [ ] Can optimize with real returns (Task 4)
- [ ] Results are visually compelling (Task 5)

## Time Estimate
- Phase 1: 5-7 hours
- Phase 2: 2 hours  
- Phase 3: 7-9 hours
- **Total**: 14-18 hours of implementation

## Notes for Claude Code
1. Start with Task 1 - it's blocking everything
2. Test each component thoroughly before moving on
3. Update task files with progress/questions
4. Don't skip the tests - they're important
5. Ask for clarification if requirements unclear
