# Current Task: Data Availability Testing (CLARIFIED)

**Status**: Ready to implement
**Updated**: 2025-01-06 by Desktop Claude

## Situation Summary
After code review, here's what's actually implemented:
- ✅ ExposureUniverse class (Task 2) - COMPLETE
- ✅ FREDDataFetcher class - EXISTS
- ⚠️ Rate series integration (Task 1) - PARTIAL (needs connection)
- 📋 Data availability testing (Task 3) - NOT STARTED

## Immediate Action for Claude Code

### Step 1: Quick Rate Series Integration (30 minutes)
Before testing data availability, we need to connect the rate series properly.

1. In `/src/data/total_returns.py`, add a method to handle rate series:
```python
def fetch_rate_series(
    self,
    series_id: str,
    start_date: datetime,
    end_date: datetime,
    source: str = 'FRED'
) -> pd.Series:
    """Fetch rate series and convert to returns."""
    if source == 'FRED':
        # Use existing FREDDataFetcher
        from .fred_data import FREDDataFetcher
        fred = FREDDataFetcher()
        rate_data = fred.fetch_series(series_id, start_date, end_date)
        
        # Convert annual rate to daily returns
        annual_rates = rate_data / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
        daily_returns = annual_rates / 252  # Trading days convention
        return daily_returns
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown rate source: {source}")
```

2. Update `fetch_total_returns` to handle rate series:
```python
# In fetch_total_returns method, add at the beginning:
if ticker.startswith('FRED:'):
    # Handle rate series
    series_id = ticker.replace('FRED:', '')
    return self.fetch_rate_series(series_id, start_date, end_date)
```

### Step 2: Implement Data Availability Test (Main Task)
Create `/scripts/test_data_availability.py` as specified in Task 3.

Key requirements:
1. Test all 16 exposures from the exposure universe
2. Test each implementation option (primary and fallbacks)
3. Test FRED data access
4. Generate clear report showing what works and what doesn't

### Step 3: Run and Report
1. Run the test script
2. Update this file with results
3. Identify any data gaps that need addressing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Rate series integration works (can fetch FRED:DGS3MO)
- [ ] All 16 exposures tested
- [ ] Clear report generated showing data availability
- [ ] Any mutual fund data issues identified
- [ ] Recommendations for fixing data gaps
